# Kaggle-Advanced-Housing
Attempts at the Kaggle Advanced Regression competition, centered around Ames, Iowa housing prices.
The first two notebooks, house_price_reg_competition and house_price_reg_competition_2, show my attempts at using PCA to counter the dataset's high dimensionality. The feature_importance notebooks show my attempts at feature engineering and "pruning", and finding a model with low CV error. My final test error was 0.189, a vast improvement from previous attempts, but this score kept me below 3000th place in a competition of a little over 4000 participants. I definitely plan on revisiting this competition when I find the time (at the time of writing this readme, my last year of college had just begun).
(Note: data_description.txt was provided by Kaggle on the competition page, I just wanted to include it here because it was very important in my attempts at feature pruning.)
